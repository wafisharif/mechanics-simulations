This mechanics simulator simulates projectile motion with conceptual physics features, including: velocity, launch angle, gravity, time, and three vectors (net force, acceleration, velocity) on each projectile.

The simulator includes two projectiles which can launch side-by-side for easy comparison.

However, the simulator does not account for air resistance yet.

There is an option to toggle real time, with which the motion of the projectiles slows down or speeds up accordingly.

The simulation will continue to be updated.
